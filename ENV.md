# Environment Variables 

## A Brief Recap:
An environment variable  or EnVar, is a variable whose value is set outside the main code of a program, it is made up of a name/value pair.
   - eg: ```SENDER=username@email.com ```
During initialization or at runtime, refrences to these keys in the code are replaced with its current value
 
> If you are unfamilure with environment variables you can read more here [using-environment-variables](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables)

Environment variables can be defined for a step, job, or entire workflow. see [Workflow syntax for GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv)

## Setting Custom EnVars
- Note that Environment variables are case-sensitive.  

To set new custom EnVars, you will need to specify the variables in the workflow [file](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
