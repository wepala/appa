## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Before running the project, you will first need to set up some environment variables.
Create a new file in the `root` of the project called `.env`
Copy the contents of the `.env-dist` file into the `.env` and fill out the blanks

## Deployment

Deployments are done through Github actions. They are automatically triggered for Android and iOS when a pull request is made for a **release branch**. They are also triggered when new commits are pushed to a release branch.

For Android releases, we need the following information setup:

- ANDROID_KEYSTORE \- Base64 encoded key store
- ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD \- Password for the key store
- ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS \- Alias/name of the key
- ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD \- Password for the key

For iOS, we currently need a developer team added to the project to create an IPA.
